# TIC TAC TOE

I did this development on the basis of my development of a tic-tac-toe game in Java as an exercise in web development.

## Game Rules

- The aim of the game is to form a sequence of three identical symbols, which can be aligned either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. Simultaneously, players strive to prevent their opponent from achieving the same sequence.
- The game commences with the player labeled as "X," and this designation alternates after each turn. This means that the player who starts as "X" in one round will become "O" in the next, ensuring a fair and balanced gameplay.
